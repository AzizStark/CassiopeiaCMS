For Password hasing use: https://stasher.netlify.com

For faster image loading create image transformations in cloudinary 
and set transformation names in `client/src/views/transformations.json`

In the following format:

{
  "transformations": {
    "cards": "YOUR TRANSFORMATION1 NAME/",
    "header": "YOUR TRANSFORMATION2 NAME/"
  }
}

Enter 'https://yourdomainname/admin/dashboard' to access the admin panel.

Thats all!
